Simple Puzzle game where the goal is to slow down the flow of lava and delay it from reaching the town until people can be evacuated.

Score is based on how long you can delay the lava flow - the longer the better.   Give people the time they need to evacuate safely!  Delay the inevitable!

This is a project where everything was created in less than 48 hours by myself.  Uses the Unity game engine.
